# OddsDB

Linking the odds of road cycling events with an existing database of teams, riders and more with the goal of visualizing the data.

Entries in the odds table should be entered both pre-event and during, and each entry should be related to the corresponding rider, team, race, bookmaker 
and timestamp in the database. This will allow for countless interesting analyses across races and seasons.
