# OddsDB

The goal of the project is to create a system to link the odds of road cycling events with an existing database.

Entries in the odds table should be entered both pre-event and during, and each entry should be related to the corresponding rider, team, race, bookmaker 
and timestamp in the database. This will allow for countless interesting analyses across races and seasons.
